			<section id="genderequality">
			<h4>
				Gender equality talks about the freedom of both Men and Women to enjoy their rights as a human, equally and correctly.
				This includes the right to life, job and other opportunities that can be done by both genders. Do you know that back in the past, women in the Philippines
				can't run on any positions in the government? Yes, it was back then, but when 
				<a href="https://psa.gov.ph/content/q-magna-carta-women-republic-act-no-9710">Magna Carta of Women</a> was released, the power to run for position was 
				opened and widely accepted for women with equal opportunity as men has.<br>
			
				Each of us was blessed with the greatest gift we could ever have, life. Therefore, it is right and just to be able to use our lives
				without discrimination and labels. Whether you are a man or a woman, you should standup, speakout, and stop being blinded by the misguided society, 
				lead the step towards betterness. On top of that, you should be able to differentiate terminologies.

		<br>In accordance to the topic, here are some useful terminologies from <cite>Medical News Today</cite> by Tim Newman: <br> 
		
	<section id="sex">
	<header class="Header" id="sexHeader">Sex</header>
			<h4>					
			"Sex" generally refers to biological differences.										
			The differences between male and female sexes are anatomical and physiological; "sex" tends to relate to biological differences.
			For instance, male and female genitalia, both internal and external are, of course, different; similarly, the levels and types of hormones present in male and female bodies are different.
			It is genetics which defines the sex of an individual. Women have 46 chromosomes including two Xs and men have 46 including an X and a Y. The Y chromosome is dominant and carries the signal for the embryo to begin growing testes.
			Women have higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than they do of testosterone; men have more testosterone than estrogen and progesterone.

	<section id="gender">
		<header class="Header" id="genderHeader">Gender</header> 
			<h4>
			"Gender" tends to denote the social and cultural role of each sex within a given society.
			Rather than being purely assigned by genetics as sex differences generally are, gender roles are adhered to as an (often subliminal) response to family interactions,
			the media, peers and education.
