				<h4>Mission<br></h4>
				<p>We,the students of Saint Louis University, are one with people who are strongly dedicated to raise
				social awareness and advocacies, in relation to timely issues like <i>Gender Equality</i>. We would like to make a way wherein
				both gender will understand the abilities they have, rights that they should stand for and the equality they deserve to live with.
				They say that big differences starts from small steps, that is why we chose Barangay Balacbac, Sto. Tomas Proper in Baguio City 
				to be the focus of this study and also gather information on what they can say about gender equality and make them more open in different facts, studies and point-of-views 
				where they can be able to achieve understanding the human nature and behaviour.</p>
				
				<h4>Vision</h4>
				<p>Knowledge, understanding, respect and acceptance to changes, are some of the keys in having a better society that we are looking forward to achieve.
				We are truly responsible with our actions towards our fellowmen, and in order to that we should be more knowledgeable about gender equality,
				to be more equipped as human with proper perspective and mindset. As human beings who are equally given the life to live, we should 
				avoid the act of descriminating races, giving labels and belittling others. We are here to inspire people who are doubting to make actions
				and take a step towards greater good, to be humane enough to standup for the equality that both genders deserve to enjoy,
				be the eyes and ears to those who can't hear aches and pleases of others and lead these misguided people who are being blinded with 
				ignorance and baseless information, to be enlighted to the path that will lead to unity and equality. </p>
