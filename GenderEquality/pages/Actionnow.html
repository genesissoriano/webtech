		<h4>How to prevent Gender Unequality?</h4>
			<div class = "Steps">
			
			<h4> This are the steps to follow to prevent the Gender Unequality. </h4>
				<h4 >Understand power and discrimination.</h4>
				<p>Sexual harassment is not about sex but about abusing power. 
				Human diversity means differences, and these should be celebrated. Attaching a value of superiority or inferiority 
				to a difference leads to discrimination and exclusion. For example, in India, being born fair skinned, in upper caste, 
				or male are all considered superior, which has led to generations of discrimination against those who do not belong to these groups.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Recognize gender diversity</h4>
			<p>Gender-based discrimination should be approached within a broader diversity framework. 
			Discrimination is influenced by other factors such as ethnicity, race, religion, caste, ability, and age, to name a few. 
			An illiterate, poor widow in rural India grapples with very different gender issues than a young, educated, urban woman faces. </p>
			
			<br>
			<h4>Start with self</h4>
			<p>Change always begins with the self. Each one of us plays multiple roles in our lives. We may belong to some powerful
			groups that set the rules. We may also belong to groups that must follow rules set by others. For example, I am an Indian woman, a mother, 
			a daughter, and from upper caste. As a woman in a patriarchal society I belong to a subordinated group, but as an upper-caste Indian, I belong to 
			the dominant. My adolescent daughter is expected to follow the rules I set as a mother, but as a daughter, I am expected to obey my parents.   
			Each of us can become more conscious of our experiences with power and disempowerment and draw from them to be more inclusive and nondiscriminatory 
			when we are the ones in positions of power</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h4>Meet the other.</h4>
			<p>We must try to understand other groups. We must check our assumptions and use these three strategies: 
			suspend judgment, engage with curiosity, and find common ground. Example the LGBT we should them right</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h4>Raise our boys and girls with the right values</h4>
			<p>We must raise children with the values of equality, nondiscrimination, nonviolence, and appreciation 
			for diversity. In our roles as mothers and teachers, we must be careful to impart the right messages, not only through our words, but by our actions.</p>
			
			<br>
			 <h4>Create an enabling environment</h4>
			<p> We must build the capacities of the legislative and judiciary bodies, police, media, and other stakeholders we work alongside to be sensitive and responsive 
			 to gender discrimination in their policies and practices.As an organization committed to diversity and gender equality, IntraHealth must promote these strategies internally and 
			 continue to find opportunities in our projects to advocate for zero tolerance to gender-based violence in the health workforce and in the communities where we work.With collective 
			 resolve and actions, we can create a new world where women are not endangered but are instead energized, enlightened, and empowered.</p>
