					<h3><b>Sto. Tomas Proper Barangay</b></h3>
					<p>Sto. Tomas Proper Barangay is more commonly known as Balacbac. The people who first lived in
					this community got the word balacbac from "bakbak" which is a Kankana-ey word for frog because 
					they said that there are a lot of frogs in here and they can hear the croaking of frogs during 
					the night time.
					<p>Sto. Tomas Proper is a barangay that is located in the South-West of Baguio City. It has
					6 puroks namely; Balacbac Central,Lower Balacbac,Interior A, Interior B, Interior C and 
					Teacher's Village.
					<p>The barangay hall is located at Balacbac Central. Apugan and Barangay Dontogan are the neighbouring
					communities of Sto. Tomas Proper Barangay.
					<p>It is not to be confused with Mt. Santo Tomas, a mountain located further south in the municipality of Tuba.
					Sometimes tourists get lost because they are confused with the name of  the barangay and the mountain.
